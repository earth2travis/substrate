## [2026-05-04] no-op | Daily synthesis — no new/changed sources
- Ingest: 311 files scanned, 0 new, 0 changed, 0 orphan findings
- No synthesis required. Exiting cleanly.

## [2026-05-04] create | Cron job: substrate-daily-synthesis
- Automated daily synthesis pipeline wired
- Runs daily at 06:00 UTC via cron job `89294cb62751`
- Flow: `_ingest.py` generates digest → agent reads digest → synthesizes findings → creates/updates insights → commits → opens PR
- Branch naming: `auto/ingest-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`
- Early exit if no new/changed/orphan files
- Constraint: never modifies `research/raw/`
